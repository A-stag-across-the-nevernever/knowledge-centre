  culturalContext: string;
}

const DOMAIN_NAMING: Record<string, DomainNaming> = {
  education: {
    domainId: 'education',
    primaryName: 'Living Library',
    alternatives: ['Athenaeum', 'Sanctum', 'Scholar\'s Archive'],
    serverName: 'Living Library Server',
    gatekeeperName: 'School Gatekeeper',
    culturalContext: 'Growing knowledge, lifelong learning',
  },

console.log(naming.primaryName);  // "Neural Nexus"

// Display to user
const welcomeMessage = `Welcome to ${naming.primaryName} - ${naming.culturalContext}`;
// "Welcome to Neural Nexus - Connected intelligence, innovation"
```

### UI/UX Adaptation

Each domain gets:
